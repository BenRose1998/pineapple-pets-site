    We started into the rescue world by fostering for fur and feathers animal sanctuary in Wythall then a phone call from the vet as they had a healthy staff booked in to be pts for no good reason and that started us off. We uphold a non destruction policy, unless advised by a vet the animal is suffering, and offer full rescue backup for the life of any animal you adopt from us so if anything happens they will always have a home and never end up in the wrong hands. 
    Pineapple Pet Sanctuary is a not for profit organisation, which is mainly self funded and also helped through public and private donations.

    Based in the West Midlands, we rescue and rehome animals in need. Full rescue back up, should the animal need to re homed again. Volunteers provide foster homes for the animals, and we provide the food and vet costs. Home checks are completed free of charge for all fosters and potential adopters. Meet and greets arranged and a 2 week trial is offered prior to adoption, adoption fee applies (unless exempt).
